# RPSLS
A simulation for the (rock paper scissors lizard Spock) Game.

I was always super fascinated by the RPS game statistics. If you've played the game for 1 million round you'll get a 1/3 chance of a tie than a win or a loss. When the game is being played between friends they'll tie more than winning or losing. That's why the game RPSLS is more fun to play a very low tieing expectation and more fun interaction.

The program is a simple C++ code that runs a simulation of a 10million game of RPS and a 10million game of RPSLS and shows the results.
